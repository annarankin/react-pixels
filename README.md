# Features ✨

### Pencil & Fill tools
  - Need to implement decent flood-fill ✅
  - Add new "modes" - pencil/fill ✅
  - Allow user to choose using UI ✅

### Palette Customization
  - Create interface to allow users to change/save/export/whatnot their own color palettes. ✅
  - How to persist? Shareable? **(Using presets for now.)**

### Save/Load
  - Allow users to save/load JSON objects representing image. ✅

### Building with Electron
  - `npm run dist` should work fine. Just need to make sure there are no code-signing problems. 

# Bugs! 🐛

- Grid toggle button does not trigger a re-render of the canvas.

# Upcoming Features 🌅

## Next:

### Export
  - Save png to user's comp

### Layers
  - Allow multiple layers! _(Note: Abstract the grid to layer)_
  - Allow users to move individual layers

### Resize Canvas
  - Allow user to use slider/input/whatever to choose resolution of image.
  - What happens when they resize after drawing? New canvas? Lose info?

## Later:

### Replay
  - Allow user to "replay" the creation of their image.
  - Possibly add ability to export this as a gif!! That would be cooooool.

### Gradient Tool
  - Fun tool to allow patterned fill! Maybe.

### Social media sharing?
  - Meh. Maybe.
