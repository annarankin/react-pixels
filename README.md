# Pixelectronica :fire:

Electron/React/Redux application for creating pixel art!

![Example Image](./pixelling.gif)

## Installation

1. Clone the repo!
1. `npm run install`!
1. `npm start`!
1. Doodle!!

Work in progress. Right now, save/load don't work.

## Tools

- [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) - awesomely simple tool for building cross-platform apps! SO EXCITE
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - for building HTML components and managing UI
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) - for retaining and managing app-wide state
- [lodash](https://lodash.com/) - for workin' with data structures more easily

## TO DO/Notes:

### Pencil & Fill tools
  - Need to implement decent flood-fill ✅
  - Add new "modes" - pencil/fill ✅
  - Allow user to choose using UI ✅

### Gradient Tool
  - Fun tool to allow patterned fill! Maybe.

### Palette Customization
  - Create interface to allow users to change/save/export/whatnot their own color palettes.
  - How to persist? Shareable?

### Resize Canvas
  - Allow user to use slider/input/whatever to choose resolution of image.
  - What happens when they resize after drawing? New canvas? Lose info?

### Save/Load
  - Persist history & allow loading of history.

### Replay
  - Allow user to "replay" the creation of their image.
  - Possibly add ability to export this as a gif!! That would be cooooool.

### Export
  - Save png to user's comp

### Social media sharing?
  - Meh. Maybe.

### Layers
  - Allow multiple layers!
  - Allow users to move individual layers
